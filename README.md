This first web page has much hidden knowledge in it!  What can you learn from the patterns? 
### 10 Scavenger Hunt Questions:###
These get harder as you go.  
1. What are the blue parts (light) | yellow parts (dark)?
**They are HTML tags**
2. What is true about ALL of these (the ends)?
**They all have left/right angle brackets, whcih show tags**
3. What is true about MOST of these (the two part)?
**Most have a slash, which show the end, but some don't, like <hr>**
4. What is true about SOME of these in links and images: red parts (light) | white parts (dark)?
**The red links are towards images found inside of the blue links**
5. What do the indentations "mean"?  What do they "do"?
**The indentations show sections, subsections, and smaller groups. It makes the code organized so readers know where each line of code will go on a webpage**
6. What do the green parts "mean"?  What do they "do"?
**The green parts are like CSS code references, which seems like coding CSS without a seperate tab. They could also appear as a reference for the viewer**
7. What is the difference between the first "My Dog" and the second "My Dog" in Chrome?
**The first My Dog is bolded, larger, and in a heading. The second is smaller, normal thickness, and is displayed as normal text. 
8. How do you hide lines 4 and 5 (meta tags, which we don't need to know about for a VERY long time)?
**The sidebar allows the user to minimize certain lines by clicking on the minus signs are plus signs to maximize**
9. What do you think it means when an html tag begins with <! ?
**These are reference lines, which means that the code does not stop and run that line, but it is like a placeholder**
10. Why is the second My Dog rendered red in the browser? 
**The My Dog is red as the CSS file shows that the H1 tag, "My Dog", will be red**
